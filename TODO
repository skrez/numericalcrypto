- Write implementations for the different methods of computing propagation of linear and nonlinear PDE
- Use tool to find optimal parameters
- relinearization? (how do we discuss this/ evaluate this?)


2 curves
What is the maximum depth we can get to without the error blowing up?
Function of method
function of problem size

another quantity: computation time


for linear
for nonlinear (reaction diffusion equation)
